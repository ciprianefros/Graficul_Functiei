# Graficul_Functiei

This is a project made by Ciprian Efros with Moise Ioana Simina, both persueing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the
University "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" from Iasi. It was made in the first university semester as part of the evaluation process of
the Introduction to Programming class. We had to make an application using a simple Graphic library, WinBGIM, that is supposed
to draw the Graph of any function. It also can draw the graphs of more functions at a time, and has other interesting features
such as drawing the asymptotes, etc.

While making this application we had to work together in order to solve the bugs that come in our way and we also deepened our 
knowledge of the C/C++ programming language.
